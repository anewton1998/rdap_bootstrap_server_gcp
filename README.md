# RDAP Bootstrap Server

The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) defines a bootstrapping process in [RFC 7484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7484).
A bootstrap server aids clients by reading the bootstrapping information published by IANA and using
it to send HTTP redirects to RDAP queries. Clients utilizing a bootstrap server will not need to
conduct their own bootstrapping.

This is a fork of https://github.com/arineng/rdap_bootstrap_server to be adapted to for the Google Cloud Platform App Engine.

## Versioning, Building And Runtime Requirements

Any version containing the word SNAPSHOT is a development version. Versions are:

* 1000.0-SNAPSHOT reflects the master branch development version. It is set high at a major version
number of 1000 so that the master branch is not re-versioned for every release.
* 1.0.0 - First release. At the time of this release, the IANA bootstrap files are available but contain
no usable content, and the embedded bootstrap files point to our best known locations for servers. Minor
point release may occur to update the embedded files until the IANA files become populated with useful
data.
* 1.1.0 - A few small things:
    - IANA and AFRINIC have been taken out of the bootstrap files as they do not have servers ready yet.
    - /help now works instead of giving a 500
    - /help shows the dates of load and dates of the bootstrap files
    - /help limits the URLs in the statistics to 100 per category
* 1.1.1 - Bugfixes to /help and to parsing of IANA files
* 1.2.0 - Added match_scheme_on_redirect option.
* 1.2.1 - Fix to using IANA bootstrapping files according to current RFCs

This server is written as a Java servlet and should run in any Java Servlet 3.0 container or higher.
It should build against Java 6 or higher.

To build using Gradle:

```
gradle test
```

which will create the build and run the unit tests. The resulting war file will be in `build/libs`.

## Deploying and Testing

Deploying the WAR file depends on the Servlet container/server you are using. It is usually as simple
as copying the WAR file to a particular directory. The WAR file comes bundled with some bootstrap files
so testing can take place before fully configuring the bootstrap.

The URL path for querying the servlet will depend on your Servlet container and the configuration you
have given to the container for this servlet. If you are using JBoss, the URL path defaults to `/rdapbootstrap`.

To test the bootstrap server, issue an RDAP query such as `ip/1.1.1.1`. You should see a redirect to
APNIC's RDAP server.

```
$ wget http://localhost:8080/rdapbootstrap/ip/1.1.1.1
--2015-04-24 16:24:39--  http://localhost:8080/rdapbootstrap/ip/1.1.1.1

## Getting Help

If you have questions or need help with this software, you may use the issue tracker on
[GitHub](https://github.com/arinlabs/rdap_bootstrap_server/issues) or you may use the
[ARIN Technical Discussions ](http://lists.arin.net/mailman/listinfo/arin-tech-discuss)
mailing list (it is a very low volume list).

## Properties and Bootstrap Files

Bootstrap files may either be listed in a properties file pointed to by the system property
`arin.rdapbootstrap.resource_files` or they may be listed using system properties directly. Here is
an example of a properties file pointed to by `arin.rdapbootstrap.resource_files`:

    default_bootstrap = /default_bootstrap.json
    as_bootstrap = /as_bootstrap.json
    domain_bootstrap = /domain_bootstrap.json
    v4_bootstrap = /v4_bootstrap.json
    v6_bootstrap = /v6_bootstrap.json
    entity_bootstrap = /entity_bootstrap.json

The system properties directly listing these are the keys of the properties file prefixed with
`arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.`. So the AS bootstrap would be `arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.as_bootstrap`, etc...

The server ships with a properties file that points to a set of built-in bootstrap files. These bootstrap files
are useful for getting the server up and running, but ultimately will need to be replaced with files
that are updated periodically from the IANA.

So there are three types of configuration.

### Configuration Setup Type 1 Example

Do nothing and let the server use the bootstrap files that ship with it.

### Configuration Setup Type 2 Example

Set the Java system property `arin.rdapbootstrap.resource_files` to be `/var/rdap/resource_files.properties`.

In the the `/var/rdap/resource_files.properties` file have the following:

    default_bootstrap = /var/rdap/default_bootstrap.json
    as_bootstrap = /var/rdap/as_bootstrap.json
    domain_bootstrap = /var/rdap/domain_bootstrap.json
    v4_bootstrap = /var/rdap/v4_bootstrap.json
    v6_bootstrap = /var/rdap/v6_bootstrap.json
    entity_bootstrap = /var/rdap/entity_bootstrap.json

### Configuration Setup Type 3 Example

Have the following Java system properties:

    arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.default_bootstrap = /var/rdap/default_bootstrap.json
    arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.as_bootstrap = /var/rdap/as_bootstrap.json
    arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.domain_bootstrap = /var/rdap/domain_bootstrap.json
    arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.v4_bootstrap = /var/rdap/v4_bootstrap.json
    arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.v6_bootstrap = /var/rdap/v6_bootstrap.json
    arin.rdapbootstrap.bootfile.entity_bootstrap = /var/rdap/entity_bootstrap.json
    
## Updating Bootstrap Files

The server checks every minute to see if a file has been modified, and if any of them have it will
automatically reload all of them.

The AS, v4, v6, and domain files will be published periodically by IANA. You can set a cron or system
process to fetch them, perhaps once a week, from the following places:

    http://data.iana.org/rdap/asn.json
    http://data.iana.org/rdap/ipv4.json
    http://data.iana.org/rdap/ipv6.json
    http://data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json

The other bootstrap files take the form of the IANA files but are custom to your particular installation
of the bootstrap server.

### Entity Bootstrap File

The entity bootstrap file is used to redirect queries for entities based on the last component of the
entity handle or identifier. Some registries, most notably all of the RIRs, append a registry signifier
such as `-ARIN`. While entity bootstrapping is not officially part of the IETF specification, this
server attempts to issue redirects based on those signifiers if present. Here is an example of an
entity bootstrap file:

```json
{
  "rdap_bootstrap": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "publication": "2014-09-09T15:39:03-0400",
    "services": [
      [
        [
          "ARIN"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdappilot.arin.net/restfulwhoi/rdap/",
          "http://rdappilot.arin.net/restfulwhois/rdap/"
        ]
      ],
      [
        [
          "AP"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdap.apnic.net/",
          "http://rdap.apnic.net/"
        ]
      ],
      [
        [
          "RIPE"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdap.db.ripe.net/",
          "http://rdap.db.ripe.net/"
        ]
      ],
      [
        [
          "AFRINIC"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdap.rd.me.afrinic.net/whois/AFRINIC/",
          "http://rdap.rd.me.afrinic.net/whois/AFRINIC/"
        ]
      ],
      [
        [
          "LACNIC"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdap.labs.lacnic.net/rdap/",
          "http://rdap.labs.lacnic.net/rdap/"
        ]
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Default Bootstrap File

The default bootstrap file is consulted when all the other bootstrap files have failed. It takes the
following form:

```json
{
  "rdap_bootstrap": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "publication": "2014-09-09T15:39:03-0400",
    "services": [
      [
        [
          "ip",
          "autnum",
          "nameserver"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdappilot.arin.net/restfulwhois/rdap/",
          "http://rdappilot.arin.net/restfulwhois/rdap/"
        ]
      ],
      [
        [
          "entity"
        ],
        [
          "https://rdappilot.arin.net/restfulwhois/rdap/",
          "http://rdappilot.arin.net/restfulwhois/rdap/"
        ]
      ],
      [
        [
          "domain"
        ],
        [
          "https://tlab.verisign.com/COM/",
          "http://tlab.verisign.com/COM/"
        ]
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

Each service type in this file represents an RDAP query type.

## Redirect Scheme Matching

By default, this server will always attempt to issue HTTPS redirects. This should not be a problem
because all RDAP clients are _REQUIRED_ to support both HTTP and HTTPS. However, if it is necessary
to try to keep the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) for the redirect that was given in the query, this
behavior can be set with the system property `arin.rdapbootstrap.match_scheme_on_redirect=TRUE`.
Note that this is a system property and is not part of the `resouce_files.properties` file.
